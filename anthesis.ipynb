    "    **Objective:** Perform a GAP analysis for a specific sustainability disclosure requirement based on provided information. Compare the company's current public disclosures against the official requirement details and generate an assessment of readiness, identify the gaps, and provide actionable recommendations.\n",
    "    **Context:**\n",
    "    You are acting as an expert sustainability reporting analyst. Your task is to evaluate a company's compliance with a specific disclosure requirement, often derived from frameworks like the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). A GAP analysis involves comparing the 'current state' (what the company discloses) with the 'desired state' (what the standard requires).\n",
    "    You will receive the following pieces of information for each analysis point:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  `Question`: A specific question addressing a particular aspect of the company's sustainability reporting.\n",
    "        * Example: \"Does the undertaking describe management and the AMS bodies' role in assessing and managing impacts, risks, and opportunities?\"\n",
    "    2.  `Disclosure Requirement`: The reference code or identifier for the specific requirement in the sustainability reporting standard (e.g., ESRS GOV-1_10).\n",
    "        * Example: \"(GOV-1_10) Description of management's role in governance processes\"\n",
    "    3.  `Retrieved Disclosure Requirement Content`: The detailed text from the official standard or regulation explaining *exactly* what needs to be disclosed for this requirement. This defines the 'desired state'.\n",
    "        * Example: \"The ESRS requires companies to provide specific details about how management’s role in ESG governance is structured and the processes used to manage sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\"\n",
    "    4.  `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures`: The actual text or summary of information found in the company's reports (sustainability reports, annual reports, website, etc.) that relates to the `Question`. This represents the 'current state'.\n",
    "        * Example: \"The company provides general descriptions of how management assesses risks but does not mention sustainability-related risks explicitly. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter mentions oversight of ESG programs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Task:**\n",
    "    Based *only* on the provided input data (`Retrieved Disclosure Requirement Content` and `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures`), perform a GAP analysis by determining the following three components:\n",
    "    1.  **Readiness:** Assess the company's preparedness to meet the specific disclosure requirement based *solely* on the retrieved content.\n",
    "        * **\"Yes\"**: The `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures` fully addresses all aspects mentioned in the `Retrieved Disclosure Requirement Content` and directly answers the `Question`.\n",
    "        * **\"No\"**: The `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures` is missing entirely, is irrelevant to the `Question`/`Requirement Content`, or clearly fails to address the core aspects of the requirement. This includes cases where the disclosure doesn't exist yet (e.g., \"Sustainability statement does not yet exist\").\n",
    "        * **\"Partially\"**: The `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures` addresses some aspects of the `Retrieved Disclosure Requirement Content` but is incomplete, lacks necessary detail, is ambiguous, or fails to cover all key elements required.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Overview of GAP:** Provide a brief, specific description of the discrepancies or alignment between the `Retrieved Content from publicly available company disclosures` and the `Retrieved Disclosure Requirement Content`.\n",
    "        * If Readiness is \"Yes\", briefly state that the requirement appears met based on the provided text.\n",
    "        * If Readiness is \"No\" or \"Partially\", clearly state *what* is missing, incomplete, unclear, or non-compliant in the company's content when compared to the requirement's details. Avoid generic statements; pinpoint the specific information deficit.\n",
    "        * Example (for \"No\"): \"The company content describes general risk management but lacks specific details on how *sustainability* impacts, risks, and opportunities are assessed by management, as required.\"\n",
    "        * Example (for \"Partially\"): \"While oversight by a committee is mentioned, the specific *processes* used by management for assessment and management, as required by the standard, are not detailed.\"\n",
    "        * Example (for \"Yes\"): \"The company's disclosure describes the management's role and oversight committee, aligning with the requirement's core elements based on the provided text.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Recommendations:** Provide clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for the company to bridge the identified gaps and achieve full compliance with the disclosure requirement.\n",
    "        * Recommendations should directly address the issues identified in the `Overview of GAP`.\n",
    "        * Focus on *what* the company needs to *do* or *disclose*.\n",
    "        * If Readiness is \"Yes\", the recommendation can be brief, suggesting maintaining the current level of detail or considering enhancements for clarity.\n",
    "        * Example (for \"No\"/\"Partially\"): \"Enhance the disclosure to explicitly detail the processes management uses to assess and manage sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities. Specify how this integrates with overall governance and risk management frameworks. Consider outlining the frequency and nature of management reviews related to ESG.\"\n",
    "        * Example (for \"Yes\"): \"Maintain the current level of detail. Consider adding a diagram illustrating the governance structure for ESG oversight to further enhance clarity.\"\n",
